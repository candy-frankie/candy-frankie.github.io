<li>You’ve never seen buildings like this. The stunning bamboo homes built by Elora Hardy and her team in Bali twist, curve and surprise at every turn. They <strong>defy</strong>（藐视/公开反对） convention because the bamboo itself is so <strong>enigmatic</strong>(神秘的；高深莫测的；谜一般的). No two <strong>poles of bamboo</strong>（竹竿） are alike, so every home, bridge and bathroom is exquisitely unique. In this beautiful, <strong>immersive</strong>(身临其境) talk, she shares the potential of bamboo, as both a sustainable resource and a spark for the imagination. “We have had to invent our own rules,” she says.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="About_author"><strong>About author</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Growing up in Bali with two artist parents, Elora Hardy’s creativity led her to design prints for one of New York’s biggest fashion houses. Then, in a dramatic shift, she moved back home and founded Ibuku, a team that builds <strong>bespoke</strong>（(尤指服装、网站、电脑程序等)定制的） homes made and furnished almost entirely of bamboo. </li>
<li>The strength of this abundant local grass allows for <strong>towering</strong>（高耸的）, <strong>curvilinear</strong>（由曲线组成的） structures with a notable sense of luminosity and comfort. Ibuku builds on a design process and an engineering system that were first established at the nearby Green School. Five years ago, Elora and her team chose one <strong>humble</strong>（普通的、一般的） material, and with it they are building a whole new world.<h3 id="Video"><strong>Video</strong></h3></li>

<h3 id="Subtitles_and_Transcript"><strong>Subtitles and Transcript</strong></h3><blockquote>
<p>When I was nine years old, my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like, and I drew this <strong>fairy</strong>(童话般的) mushroom. And then she actually built it. (Laughter)</p>
<p>I don’t think I realized this was so unusual at the time, and maybe I still haven’t, because I’m still designing houses. This is a six-story bespoke home on the island of Bali. It’s built almost entirely from bamboo. The living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor. You enter the house by a bridge. It can get hot in the tropics, so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes. But some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in and the bugs out. This room we left open. We made an air-conditioned, tented bed. And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room. <strong>Boxing off</strong>（把…闭锁分隔，把…隔成(小间)：The room was boxed off。那个房间被分隔开来了） an area with tall walls just didn’t feel right, so instead, we made this giant woven <strong>pod</strong>（豆荚）.</p>
<p>Now, we do have all the necessary luxuries, like bathrooms. This one is a basket in the corner of the living room, and I’ve got tell you, some people actually hesitate to use it. We have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation. (Laughter) So there are lots of things that we’re still working on, but one thing I have learned is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right.</p>
<p>It’s actually a <strong>wild grass</strong>（野草）. It grows on otherwise <strong>unproductive land</strong>（不毛之地 ; 非生产性土地）， deep <strong>ravines</strong>（ A ravine is a very deep, narrow valley with steep sides. 沟壑; 深谷）, mountainsides. It lives off（以…为食料；靠…生活；住在…之外） of rainwater, spring water, sunlight, and of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world, we use just seven of them.</p>
<p>That’s my dad. He’s the one who got me building with bamboo, and he is standing in a <strong>clump</strong>(A clump of things such as trees or plants is a small group of them growing together. (树或植物的) 丛) of Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago. Each year, it sends up a new generation of shoots. That shoot, we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week, so we’re talking about sustainable timber in three years.</p>
<p>Now, we harvest from hundreds of family-owned <strong>clumps</strong>(意指竹林). Betung, as we call it, it’s really long, up to 18 meters of usable length. Try getting that truck down the mountain. And it’s strong: it has the <strong>tensile</strong>（拉力的；可伸长的；可拉长的） strength of steel, the <strong>compressive strength</strong>（抗压强度；[力] 压缩强度） of concrete. <strong>Slam four tons straight down</strong>（ If you slam something down, you put it there quickly and with great force. 摔; 使劲扔） on a pole, and it can take it. Because it’s hollow, it’s lightweight, light enough to be lifted by just a few men, or, apparently, one woman.</p>
<p>And when my father built Green School in Bali, he chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus, because he saw it as a promise. It’s a promise to the kids. It’s one sustainable material that they will not run out of. And when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago, I just thought, this makes perfect sense. It is growing all around us. It’s strong. It’s elegant. It’s earthquake-resistant. Why hasn’t this happened sooner, and what can we do with it next?</p>
<p>So along with some of the original builders of Green School, I founded Ibuku. Ibu means “mother,” and ku means “mine,” so it represents my Mother Earth, and at Ibuku, we are a team of <strong>artisans</strong>（工匠；技工）, <strong>architects</strong>（建筑师） and designers, and what we’re doing together is creating a new way of building. Over the past five years together, we have built over 50 unique structures, most of them in Bali. Nine of them are at Green Village — you’ve just seen inside some of these homes — and we fill them with bespoke furniture, we surround them with veggie gardens, we would love to invite you all to come visit someday. And while you’re there, you can also see Green School — we keep building classrooms there each year — as well as an updated fairy mushroom house.</p>
<p>We’re also working on a little house for export. This is a traditional Sumbanese home that we replicated, right down to the details and textiles. A restaurant with an open-air kitchen. It looks a lot like a kitchen, right? And a bridge that spans 22 meters across a river.</p>
<p>Now, what we’re doing, it’s not entirely new. From little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in Java, bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world for literally tens of thousands of years. There are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts. But until recently, it was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects, and so, just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone. Unprotected bamboo weathers. Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust. And so that’s why most people, especially in Asia, think that you couldn’t be poor enough or rural enough to actually want to live in a bamboo house.</p>
<p>And so we thought, what will it take to change their minds, to convince people that bamboo is worth building with, much less worth aspiring to?</p>
<p>First, we needed safe treatment solutions. Borax is a natural salt. It turns bamboo into a <strong>viable</strong>（ 可行的；能养活的；能生育的） building material. Treat it properly, design it carefully, and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Second, build something extraordinary out of it. Inspire people. Fortunately, Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship. It values the artisan. So combine those with the adventurous outliers from new generations of locally trained architects and designers and engineers, and always remember that you are designing for curving, <strong>tapering</strong>(If something tapers, or if you taper it, it becomes gradually thinner at one end. 使逐渐变细; 逐渐变细。例：Unlike other trees, it doesn’t taper very much. It stays fat all the way up.不像其他树，它不是越往上越细，而是自下往上一样粗。), hollow poles. No two poles alike, no straight lines, no two-by-fours here. The tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture do not apply here. We have had to invent our own rules. We ask the bamboo what it’s good at, what it wants to become, and what it says is: respect it, design for its strengths, protect it from water, and to make the most of its curves.</p>
<p>So we design in real 3D, making scale structural models out of the same material that we’ll later use to build the house. And bamboo model-making, it’s an art, as well as some hardcore engineering.</p>
<p>So that’s the blueprint of the house.</p>
<p>(Laughter)</p>
<p>And we bring it to site, and with tiny rulers, we measure each pole, and consider each curve, and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile to replicate that house <strong>on site</strong>（on site 临场；在现场）.</p>
<p>When it comes down to the details, we consider everything. Why are doors so often rectangular? Why not round? How could you make a door better? Well, its hinges battle with gravity, and gravity will always win in the end, so why not have it <strong>pivot</strong>（枢轴；中心点） on the center where it can stay balanced? And while you’re at it, why not doors shaped like teardrops?</p>
<p>To reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material, we have really had to push ourselves, and within that constraint, we have found space for something new. It’s a challenge: how do you make a ceiling if you don’t have any flat boards to work with? Let me tell you, sometimes I dream of <strong>sheet rock</strong>（岩石块） and <strong>plywood</strong>（胶合板）. (Laughter) But if what you’ve got is skilled craftsmen and <strong>itsy-bitsy</strong>（可爱的；小巧玲珑的） little splits, weave that ceiling together, stretch a canvas over it, <strong>lacquer</strong>（涂漆；使表面光泽） it. How do you design durable kitchen <strong>countertops</strong>（(厨房的) 工作台面） that do justice to this curving structure you’ve just built? <strong>Slice up</strong>（把…切成片） a <strong>boulder</strong>（卵石，大圆石；巨砾） like a loaf of bread, hand-carve each to fit the other, leave the crusts on, and what we’re doing, it is almost entirely handmade. The structural connections of our buildings are reinforced by <strong>steel joints</strong>（钢节点）, but we use a lot of <strong>hand-whittled</strong>（手工削：If you whittle something from a piece of wood, you carve it by cutting pieces off the wood with a knife. 削 (木头)） bamboo pins. There are thousands of pins in each floor. This floor is made of <strong>glossy</strong>（ 光滑的；有光泽的） and durable bamboo skin. You can feel the texture under bare feet.</p>
<p>And the floor that you walk on, can it affect the way that you walk? Can it change the footprint that you’ll ultimately leave on the world? I remember being nine years old and feeling wonder, and possibility, and a little bit of idealism. And we’ve got a really long way to go, there’s a lot left to learn, but one thing I know is that with creativity and commitment, you can create beauty and comfort and safety and even luxury out of a material that will <strong>grow back</strong>（重新长出，比如头发：Treatment can help some hair grow back and prevent more from falling out, but you probably won’t get all your hair back）.</p>
